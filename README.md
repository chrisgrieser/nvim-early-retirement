of inactivity.

## Installation

```lua
-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-early-retirement",
	config = function () require("early-retirement").setup() end,
}

-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-early-retirement",
	config = true,
	event = "VeryLazy",
},
```

## Configuration

```lua
defaultOpts = {
	-- If a buffer has been inactive for this many minutes, close it.
	retirementAgeMins = 20,

	-- Filetypes to ignore.
	ignoredFiletypes = {},

	-- Ignore files matching this lua pattern; empty string disables this setting.
	ignoreFilenamePattern = "",

	-- Will not close the alternate file.
	ignoreAltFile = true,

	-- Minimum number of open buffers for auto-closing to become active. E.g.,
	-- by setting this to 4, no auto-closing will take place when you have 3
	-- or fewer open buffers. Note that this plugin never closes the currently
	-- active buffer, so a number < 2 will effectively disable this setting.
	minimumBufferNum = 1,

	-- Ignore buffers with unsaved changes. If false, the buffers will
	-- automatically be written and then closed.
	ignoreUnsavedChangesBufs = true,

	-- Ignore non-empty buftypes, for example terminal buffers
	ignoreSpecialBuftypes = true,

	-- Ignore visible buffers. Buffers that are open in a window or in a tab
	-- are considered visible by vim. ("a" in `:buffers`)
	ignoreVisibleBufs = true,

	-- ignore unloaded buffers. Session-management plugin often add buffers
	-- to the buffer list without loading them.
	ignoreUnloadedBufs = false,

	-- Show notification on closing. Works with plugins like nvim-notify.
	notificationOnAutoClose = false,

	-- When a file is deleted, for example via an external program, delete the
	-- associated buffer as well. Requires Neovim >= 0.10.
	-- (This feature is independent from the automatic closing)
	deleteBufferWhenFileDeleted = false,
}
```

> [!NOTE]
