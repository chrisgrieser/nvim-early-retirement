## Installation

```lua
-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-early-retirement",
	config = function () require("early-retirement").setup() end,
}

-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-early-retirement",
	config = true,
	event = "VeryLazy",
},
```

## Configuration

```lua
-- default values
opts = {
	-- if a buffer has been inactive for this many minutes, close it
	retirementAgeMins = 20,

	-- filetypes to ignore
	ignoredFiletypes = {},

	-- will not close the alternate file
	ignoreAltFile = true,

	-- minimum number of open buffers for auto-closing to become active, e.g.,
	-- by setting this to 4, no auto-closing will take place when you have 3 
	-- or less open buffers. Note that this plugin never closes the currently 
	-- active buffer, so a number < 2 will effectively disable this setting.
	minimumBufferNum = 1, 

	-- will ignore buffers with unsaved changes. If false, the buffers will
	-- automatically be written and then closed.
	ignoreUnsavedChangesBufs = true,

	-- ignore non-empty buftypes, for example terminal buffers
	ignoreSpecialBuftypes = true,

	-- ignore visible buffers ("a" in `:buffers`). buffers open in a window, 
	-- or in a tab are consider visible by vim
	ignoreVisibleBufs = true,

	-- ignore unloaded buffers. session-management plugin often add buffers
	-- to the buffer list without loading them
	ignoreUnloadedBufs = false,

	-- uses vim.notify for plugins like nvim-notify
	notificationOnAutoClose = false,
}
```
